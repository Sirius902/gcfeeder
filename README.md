The process for reading adapter inputs was based on Dolphin's Gamecube Adapter support and therefore is compatible with Dolphin's passthrough.

Requires both [vJoy and vJoyConf](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site) to be installed and the WinUSB (libusb) driver installed for the adapter (WUP-028) with [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie).
